# Interpreting Backtesting Metrics

Understanding the metrics generated by a backtest report is crucial for accurately assessing a trading strategy's performance, risk profile, and overall viability. This document provides a detailed explanation of each key metric.

### a. Return [%]
-   **Definition**: The total percentage gain or loss of the strategy over the backtesting period, relative to the initial equity.
-   **Significance**: A primary measure of profitability. A higher positive return indicates a more profitable strategy.

### b. Buy & Hold Return [%]
-   **Definition**: The percentage gain or loss if one had simply bought the asset at the beginning of the backtest and held it until the end, relative to the initial equity.
-   **Significance**: Provides a benchmark. If the strategy's return is significantly lower than buy & hold, it suggests the strategy might be underperforming a passive investment.

### c. Return (Ann.) [%]
-   **Definition**: The annualized return of the strategy, providing a normalized measure of performance over a year.
-   **Significance**: Allows for comparison of strategies run over different durations.

### d. Volatility (Ann.) [%]
-   **Definition**: The annualized standard deviation of the strategy's daily returns, representing the degree of variation in returns.
-   **Significance**: A measure of risk. Higher volatility implies higher risk.

### e. CAGR [%] (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
-   **Definition**: The mean annual growth rate of the strategy's investments over a specified period longer than one year, compounded.
-   **Significance**: Represents the smooth, geometric mean growth rate of the investment.

### f. Sharpe Ratio
-   **Definition**: Measures the excess return (strategy return minus risk-free rate) per unit of total risk (standard deviation of returns). A common proxy for the risk-free rate is typically 0%, especially for short periods or if not specified.
-   **Formula**: $S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$
    -   $R_p$: Portfolio return
    -   $R_f$: Risk-free rate
    -   $\sigma_p$: Standard deviation of portfolio's excess return
-   **Significance**: The primary metric for risk-adjusted return. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better return for the amount of risk taken. As per `GEMINI.md`, this is the **primary metric** for comparing strategies.

### g. Sortino Ratio
-   **Definition**: Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but measures excess return per unit of *downside* risk (standard deviation of negative returns).
-   **Formula**: $So = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_D}$
    -   $R_p$: Portfolio return
    -   $R_f$: Risk-free rate
    -   $\sigma_D$: Standard deviation of downside (negative) returns
-   **Significance**: Focuses on bad volatility. A higher Sortino Ratio indicates better returns for the downside risk taken. Useful for strategies where upside volatility is not considered "risk."

### h. Calmar Ratio
-   **Definition**: Measures the average annual return relative to the maximum drawdown.
-   **Formula**: $C = \frac{CAGR}{Max. Drawdown}$
-   **Significance**: Evaluates risk by comparing return to the worst historical loss. A higher Calmar Ratio implies better return per unit of maximum risk exposure.

### i. Alpha [%]
-   **Definition**: Measures a strategy's performance relative to a benchmark index (e.g., S&P 500). A positive Alpha indicates outperformance against the benchmark, adjusted for risk.
-   **Significance**: Indicates the value added by the strategy manager.

### j. Beta
-   **Definition**: Measures the volatility of a strategy relative to a benchmark index. A Beta of 1 means the strategy moves with the market, >1 means more volatile, <1 means less volatile.
-   **Significance**: Measures systematic risk.

### k. Max. Drawdown [%]
-   **Definition**: The largest percentage drop from a peak in equity to a subsequent trough.
-   **Significance**: A critical measure of risk, indicating the worst-case historical loss experienced by the strategy.

### l. Avg. Drawdown [%]
-   **Definition**: The average percentage drop across all drawdown periods.
-   **Significance**: Provides a general sense of how severe typical drawdowns are.

### m. Max. Drawdown Duration
-   **Definition**: The longest period of time (from peak to new peak) that the strategy's equity was below a previous high.
-   **Significance**: Measures how long capital can be tied up during underperforming periods.

### n. Avg. Drawdown Duration
-   **Definition**: The average duration of all trades.
-   **Significance**: Provides a general sense of how long capital is typically deployed in a single trade.

### o. # Trades
-   **Definition**: The total number of trades executed during the backtest.
-   **Significance**: Indicates the activity level of the strategy. A high number of trades can lead to increased commission costs.

### p. Win Rate [%]
-   **Definition**: The percentage of profitable trades out of the total number of trades.
-   **Significance**: Measures the consistency of winning trades.

### q. Best Trade [%]
-   **Definition**: The percentage return of the single most profitable trade.
-   **Significance**: Highlights the potential upside of a single successful trade.

### r. Worst Trade [%]
-   **Definition**: The percentage return of the single least profitable trade.
-   **Significance**: Highlights the potential downside of a single unsuccessful trade.

### s. Avg. Trade [%]
-   **Definition**: The average percentage return across all trades.
-   **Significance**: Provides a general idea of the typical profitability per trade.

### t. Max. Trade Duration
-   **Definition**: The duration of the longest trade (from entry to exit).
-   **Significance**: Can indicate if the strategy is short-term or long-term oriented.

### u. Avg. Trade Duration
-   **Definition**: The average duration of all trades.
-   **Significance**: Provides a general sense of how long capital is typically deployed in a single trade.

### v. Profit Factor
-   **Definition**: The ratio of gross profits to gross losses.
-   **Formula**: $PF = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Gross Loss}}$
-   **Significance**: A measure of trading efficiency. A Profit Factor greater than 1 indicates a profitable strategy.

### w. Expectancy [%]
-   **Definition**: The average expected profit or loss per trade, expressed as a percentage of the capital risked per trade.
-   **Significance**: Quantifies the average profitability of a trade over the long run.

### x. SQN (System Quality Number)
-   **Definition**: A measure of the overall quality of a trading system, developed by Van K. Tharp. It relates the expectancy of the system to the standard deviation of its returns.
-   **Formula**: $SQN = \frac{\text{Expectancy}}{\text{StdDev}(\text{Trade Returns})} \times \sqrt{\text{Number of Trades}}$
-   **Significance**: A higher SQN indicates a more robust and scalable trading system. Tharp suggests SQN values:
    -   1.6 - 1.9: Poor
    -   2.0 - 2.4: Average
    -   2.5 - 2.9: Good
    -   3.0 - 5.0: Excellent
    -   5.1 - 6.9: Superb
    -   7.0 - +: Holy Grail

This detailed breakdown should provide a thorough understanding of the metrics presented in the backtesting reports.
