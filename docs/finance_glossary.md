### **General Market Concepts**

-   **Bull Market:** A market condition where prices are generally rising or are expected to rise. The term "bullish" refers to a positive or optimistic outlook on price movement.

-   **Bear Market:** A market condition where prices are generally falling or are expected to fall. The term "bearish" refers to a negative or pessimistic outlook on price movement.

-   **Sideways Market (Range-Bound):** A market that is not showing a clear long-term trend in either direction. Prices tend to trade within a relatively stable high and low range. Strategies in this environment often focus on mean reversion.

### **Trading Positions**

-   **Long Position:** The act of buying an asset with the expectation that its price will rise. An investor profits from a long position if the price increases.

-   **Short Position (Short Selling):** The act of selling an asset that one does not own (by borrowing it) with the expectation that its price will fall. The investor profits by buying the asset back at a lower price to return it to the lender. Short selling is a bearish strategy.

### **Orders & Execution**

-   **Market Order:** An order to buy or sell an asset at the best available price in the current market. It guarantees execution but not the price.

-   **Limit Order:** An order to buy or sell an asset at a specific price or better. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.

-   **Stop-Loss Order:** An order placed to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price point. It is designed to limit an investor's loss on a position.

-   **Take-Profit Order:** An order placed to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price point, locking in a profit.

-   **Slippage:** The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. Slippage can occur in fast-moving markets or when a large order is executed.

### **Risk Management**

-   **Drawdown:** The peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment, strategy, or portfolio. It is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough.

-   **Risk-Reward Ratio:** A ratio used by traders to compare the expected returns of an investment to the amount of risk undertaken to capture these returns. For example, a risk-reward ratio of 1:3 means a trader is risking $1 to potentially make $3.

-   **Position Sizing:** The process of determining the appropriate number of shares or units to trade for a particular investment, based on the investor's risk tolerance and the size of their portfolio.

### **Performance Metrics**

-   **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of risk-adjusted return. It describes how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset. It is calculated as the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk.
    $$
    \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
    $$
    Where:
    - $R_p$ = Return of portfolio
    - $R_f$ = Risk-free rate
    - $\sigma_p$ = Standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return

-   **Sortino Ratio:** A variation of the Sharpe Ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns.

-   **Alpha:** A measure of the active return on an investment, the performance of that investment compared to a suitable benchmark. An alpha of 1% means the investment's return on a portfolio outperformed the benchmark's return by 1%.

-   **Beta:** A measure of the volatility—or systematic risk—of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price will move with the market. A beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market.
